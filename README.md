# heidenc-txt

This repo contains professionally typed primary sources that are part of the The Heidelberg Encyclopedia Database \[heidENC\]. The `.txt` files are accompanied by the official documentation provided to the typist.

This repository is for archival purposes, as the original database has been deactivated. The resources however are still valuable. The original project is preserved in three parts:

- The annotated [bibliography](https://hcts-hra.github.io/heidenc/)
- This repo for text files
- a Data publication for binary files


## Note

The `txt` files contain `xml` markup. Most of these contents likely found a way into other projects as proper `xml`, such as [wsc](https://github.com/hcts-hra/wsc-data).
